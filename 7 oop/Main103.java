Java – What is OOP?

    OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.

    Procedural programming is about writing steps (methods) that work on data.
    Object-Oriented Programming is about creating objects that have data (variables) and actions (methods) together.

Advantages of OOP
    OOP is easy to understand
    OOP makes programs more clear and organized
    OOP helps to keep code DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)
    OOP makes code easy to fix and change
    OOP helps to reuse code

Java – What are Classes and Objects?
    Classes and Objects are the main parts of OOP.
    Think of it like this:
        A class is like a blueprint (design)
        An object is the real thing made from the blueprint
        Example 1:
            Class:
                Fruit

            Objects:
                Apple
                Banana
                Mango

         Example 2:
            Class:
                Car

            Objects:
                Volvo
                Audi
                Toyota

Simple Definition
    A class is a template (plan) for objects.
    An object is a real item made from the class.
    When objects are created, they get:
        variables (data)
        methods (actions)
        from the class.

You will learn more about classes and objects later.
