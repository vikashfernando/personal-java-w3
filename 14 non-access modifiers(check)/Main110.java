/*
on-access modifiers
    > on-access modifiers do not control visibility (like public or private),
        but instead add other features to classes, methods, and attributes.
    > The most commonly used non-access modifiers :
        > final
            If you don't want the ability to override existing attribute values
        > static
            A static method belongs to the class, not to any specific object.
            This means you can call it without creating an object of the class.
        > abstract??????????????????
            An abstract method belongs to an abstract class, and it does not have a body.
            The body is provided by the subclass
